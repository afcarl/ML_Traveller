# ML Traveller

For the ML Traveller tasks I solved the following problems:

1. [Project Euler 96](https://projecteuler.net/problem=96).
2. Hackerrank
  * [The Missing Characters](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-missing-characters/leaderboard)
  * [Predict the Missing Grade](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/predict-missing-grade)

## Project Euler Problem 96
This problem is about solving Sudoku puzzles. This problem is rather trivial if you know about constraint logic programming solvers. 
I picked the [Numberjack python](http://numberjack.ucc.ie/) library to code my solution in. The Numberjack library lets you code the constraints in python and uses a number of efficient constraint solvers in the back to efficiently solve the problem.

## Hackerrank

### The Missing Characters
In the missing characters problem missing characters (represented by `#`) in words need to be predicted.

### Predict the Missing Grade

In the missing grade problem final grades for a Mathematics course taken by a student need to be predicted given grades from other courses done by that student.
